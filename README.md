## Install & build and run

Requirement: node.js > 7.10 (why: node 8 is around the corner, and async/await is game changer in code readibility, so, let start moving!)


```
git clone git@github.com:mvdom/mvdom-patterns.git

cd mvdom-patterns
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```

For development, you can watch & build source files with

```
npm run watch
```
